Zenburn Git Bash and VIM

This is how I zenburn the Git Bash terminal and vim and change the font, prompt and title.</br></br>

I had solarized my Git Bash terminal using:</br>
https://github.com/speedpacer/gitbash_solarized</br></br>

After I decided to switch to zenburn, I figured I would put files together in a similar fasion.


# Installation
Add or make changes to the following files/folders:</br>
~/.bashrc</br>
~/.minttyrc</br>
~/.vimrc</br>
~/.dir_colors</br>
~/.vim/colors/zenburn.vim</br>

If you clone this repo, make sure you do "ls -a" to see the hidden files.
